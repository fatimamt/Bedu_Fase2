This Repository contains all the material and evidences of the curse BEDU offers about Data Science. More specifficaly, this section covers the Second Module. Programming and Statistics with R.

Within every session we put in practice the topic we read about in the called "Prework". From it, we cover the Examples.
Once we discuss the topic in the sessions, we work in Challenges (Retos) in teams.

Finally, our evidence goes for the "Postwork" exercises to keep our practice and knowledge above what we see in sessions.
